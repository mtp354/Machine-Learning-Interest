# Machine-Learning-Interest
A project to train a neural net to distinguish between interesting and uninteresting images.

The first step is to scrape data from reddit using the /r/notinteresting and /r/mildlyinteresting domains.
The images must then be resized, labelled, cleaned and partitioned into training and testing data.
I will then try several approaches, including using pretrained neural networks and creating networks from scratch.
